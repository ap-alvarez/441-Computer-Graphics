I have implemented reflections and refractions in my ray tracer.

Almost all of the code pertaining to their actual implementation can be found in renderer.h

The algorithm works recursively, to calculate up to a set maximum number of reflections/refractions, or until the ray hits an object with no reflection/refraction.

I have included a demo which goes over the functionality of the code.
